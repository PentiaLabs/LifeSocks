A game about the beautiful start of life - and socks!

An average human male ejaculation contains over 15 million sperm per milliliter. The obvious fate of a single spermatozoon is to be eliminated. Fight your way to the top and enjoy the sweet feeling of being one in a million!

We started working on this game at [Nordic Game Jame 2015](nordicgamejam.org). Since then we have been working to improve it.
